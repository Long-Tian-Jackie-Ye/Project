Where is my project?

Hi whoever is reading this.

I am really sorry that I do not have the project on Git. I understand it is part of the requirements being marked for the project.
I have tried but I physically cannot push the file to the online repository. I have tried to zip the file and push it but, it was
still too big to push. The max for a normal push is about 24mb I believe but my file is 300,000kb + in size after being zipped.
Can't do anything about it other than the large data something. The only other way I could think of doing this is zipping
the files one by one and pushing it as such but, there is over 1000 files.
